# Glucose Monitoring System Using Near-Infrared Technology

## Project Overview
This project implements a glucose monitoring system that works without breaking the skin, using Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy. The system uses an 18-channel NIR sensor to detect glucose levels by analyzing how light is absorbed and reflected at different wavelengths up to 940 nanometers.

## How It Works
The system operates on the principle of NIR spectroscopy:
1. Light is emitted at 18 different wavelengths through the NIR sensor
2. Some light is absorbed by the tissue and glucose molecules
3. Some light is reflected back to the sensor
4. The absorption/reflection patterns at different wavelengths correlate with glucose levels
5. Data is collected every 5 minutes to track glucose variations

## Dataset
- **Input Features**: 18 channels of NIR wavelength data
